## Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Site Organization Reimbursement**
A mid-sized company with 500+ employees across multiple offices uses Claimistry to collect reimbursement forms from all locations. Field employees submit photos of receipts and forms via the web interface. The system extracts expense details overnight, and the finance team reviews and approves reimbursements the next morning rather than waiting days for physical forms to arrive by mail.

### 2. **Consulting & Project-Based Services**
A consulting firm tracks billable expenses for client projects. Consultants upload reimbursement forms after client visits. Claimistry extracts expense data and categorizes it by project and cost center, enabling accurate client billing and project profitability analysis.

### 3. **Travel & Expense Management**
A corporation with frequent business travelers uses Claimistry as their primary travel expense system. Employees scan or photograph receipts and reimbursement forms immediately after travel. The system processes multiple forms daily, generates monthly summaries by department, and supports integration with the accounting system.

### 4. **Startup & Small Business Operations**
A bootstrapped startup needs expense tracking without enterprise software costs. Claimistry provides an affordable, self-hosted solution for managing founder and team reimbursements with minimal IT overhead.

### 5. **Non-Profit Organization**
A non-profit serving 20+ partner organizations uses Claimistry to track grant-related expenses and ensure proper fund allocation. Monthly reports automatically generate compliance documentation for grants and donors.

---

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher

# Check pip is available
pip --version
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Claimistry
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all required Python packages including Flask, image processing libraries, and API clients.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# Create the file
touch .env  # On macOS/Linux
# or New-Item -Path .env -Type File  # On Windows PowerShell
```

Add the following environment variables:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration (Required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Flask Security (Optional but Recommended)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=your-csrf-secret-key-change-this-in-production

# Database Path (Optional)
DATABASE_PATH=instance/database.db

# Flask Environment
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Change default secret keys in production
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets:
  ```bash
  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
  ```
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use environment-specific `.env` files (`.env.prod`, `.env.dev`, etc.)

### Step 6: Initialize the Database

```bash
python init_db.py
```

This script creates the SQLite database and populates it with test data for development purposes.

**What gets initialized:**
- `instance/database.db` — SQLite database file
- Employee test records (5-10 sample employees)
- Sample reimbursement forms and expenses
- Necessary database tables and schema

### Step 7: Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Expected output:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Debug mode: on
```

The application is now accessible at **http://localhost:5000**

### Step 8: Verify Installation

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. You should see the Claimistry dashboard
4. Try uploading a sample form image to verify the complete workflow

## Image Processing Pipeline

### Overview

The image preprocessing pipeline enhances document quality before AI extraction, improving accuracy and reliability.

### Processing Steps

#### 1. **Image Loading & Validation**
- Load image from uploaded file
- Validate file format (JPG, PNG, PDF)
- Check file size (max 16MB default)
- Verify image dimensions (minimum 640x480)

#### 2. **Auto-Cropping**
- Detect document boundaries using edge detection
- Remove white space margins around document
- Find the largest contour representing the form
- Crop to document edges

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Convert to grayscale
2. Apply Gaussian blur
3. Canny edge detection
4. Find contours
5. Identify largest rectangle
6. Crop to boundary
```

#### 3. **Straightening/Rotation Correction**
- Detect skew angle of document
- Rotate image to alignment
- Handle both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation

**Algorithm:**
```
1. Apply edge detection
2. Hough transform for line detection
3. Calculate dominant angle
4. Rotate image by negative angle
5. Crop rotated image to bounds
```

#### 4. **Enhancement**
- Adjust contrast using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Optimize brightness
- Increase text clarity

**Techniques:**
- Histogram equalization for even brightness
- Local contrast enhancement
- Adaptive thresholding

#### 5. **Noise Reduction**
- Remove scanning artifacts
- Eliminate background noise
- Preserve text and line sharpness

**Methods:**
- Bilateral filtering
- Morphological operations
- Median filtering

#### 6. **Optimization**
- Resize to optimal dimensions for OCR
- Reduce file size for API transmission
- Maintain quality for accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "OpenAI API Key Invalid"
**Symptoms:** Error message when uploading forms
**Solutions:**
1. Verify `.env` file exists in root directory
2. Check API key is correctly copied (no extra spaces)
3. Verify API key has active credits
4. Check key has appropriate permissions
5. Try regenerating API key in OpenAI dashboard

#### Issue: "Database Error" or "No Such Table"
**Symptoms:** Application crashes or can't save data
**Solutions:**
1. Delete `instance/database.db`
2. Re-run initialization: `python init_db.py`
3. Check `instance/` directory exists
4. Verify database file permissions (should be readable/writable)

#### Issue: "Module Not Found" Error
**Symptoms:** ImportError for packages like Flask, PIL, etc.
**Solutions:**
1. Verify virtual environment is activated
2. Re-install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check Python version is 3.8+: `python --version`
4. Try pip install with --no-cache-dir flag

#### Issue: "Port 5000 Already in Use"
**Symptoms:** "Address already in use" error when starting app
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :5000  # Windows

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>  # macOS/Linux
taskkill /PID <PID> /F  # Windows
```

#### Issue: Image Upload Fails or "Invalid File Type"
**Symptoms:** File rejected during upload
**Solutions:**
1. Verify image format is JPG, PNG, or PDF
2. Check file size is under 16MB
3. Ensure image isn't corrupted (try opening in image viewer)
4. Try converting PDF to image first

#### Issue: Slow Image Processing
**Symptoms:** Form processing takes >1 minute
**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection speed
2. Monitor OpenAI API status dashboard
3. Reduce image size (crop before uploading)
4. Check system RAM availability
5. Consider batch processing during off-hours

#### Issue: Extracted Data is Incorrect
**Symptoms:** OCR/AI extraction misses values or reads incorrectly
**Solutions:**
1. Use image preprocessing: ensure form is straight and well-lit
2. Try uploading higher resolution scan
3. Manually edit extracted data in the form editor
4. Check that form matches expected format
5. Report issue if recurring pattern found

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging:

1. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```

2. Check `app.log` for detailed error messages

3. Enable browser developer tools (F12) for frontend errors

4. Run with verbose output:
   ```bash
   python -u app.py
   ```
